# Welcome to the MedAssets!!!

We build a wearable device data network based on the DePIN architecture that allows users to monetize their health data privately and securely by interacting with blockchain smart contracts, while providing a source of real-time compliance data for medical research, insurance actuarial and digital marketing

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **IoTeX L1 Blockchain** | An ultra-efficient EVM blockchain offering 1000 TPS with instant 1-block finality. Perfect for DeFi, DePIN tokenomics, Identities, and any trusted logic requiring Web3 composability. | [Repo](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core) | [Docs](https://docs.iotex.io) |
| **W3bstream** | An offchain computing layer for DePIN verifiable data computation, supporting a variety of validity proofs including Zero Knowledge (ZK), Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), and Multi-party Computation (MPC). | [Repo](https://github.com/iotexproject/w3bstream) | [Docs](https://docs.iotex.io/depin-infra-modules-dim/w3bstream-depin-verification) |
| **Quicksilver** | Quicksilver is a framework that bridges the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) to create advanced AI agents. | [Repo](https://github.com/iotexproject/quicksilver) | [Docs]([https://github.com/iotexproject/quicksilver](https://github.com/iotexproject/quicksilver#quicksilver-sentient-ai-framework)) |
| **ioID** | Provides identities for DePIN participants and devices, including on-chain and off-chain identity management and DID-based encrypted communication. | [Repo](https://github.com/iotexproject/ioID-contracts) | [Docs](https://docs.iotex.io/depin-infra-modules-dim/ioid-depin-identities) |
| **ioConnect** | Abstracts firmware development for DePIN hardware and provides examples of device registration and DID-based encrypted communication using the ioID module. | [Repo](https://github.com/iotexproject/ioconnect) | [Docs](https://docs.iotex.io/depin-infra-modules-dim/ioconnect-hardware-sdk) |
| **Marshall DAO** | A DAO that allows IoTeX stakeholders to vote on funding allocations for DePIN projects' growth and governance. | [Repo](https://github.com/iotexproject/marshall-dao) | [Docs](https://docs.iotex.io/participate/governance/the-marshall-dao) |
| **Modular Security Pool (MSP)** | A security module providing pooled security for DePIN infrastructure. | Coming Soon | [Docs](https://docs.iotex.io/depin-infra-modules-dim/msp-modular-security-pool) |
